# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly). I have been able to learn about the basics of CRUD using the basics of GET and POST. It is an introductory project to
help me learn about the workflow of building good habits using timely github commits and learning how to slowly code and 
test. Another important skill was how to debug code and this goes back to incremental coding and commits instead of trying to test for too many parameters. I still how lots to learn, not just about coding but to also refine my personal habits and quirks.  Due to time constraints I was unable to implement more advanced features as I was busy fixing bugs to ensure BASIC functionality. It is not the prettiest or the most dynamic but it works and hopefully mets the requirements of the project.
